Several Jupyter Notebook tutorials are available in the
`Github repository <https://github.com/Davide-sd/sympy-plot-backends>`_.
They are designed to illustrate the differences between the backends.

Sadly, given the high number of JS-based figures, it would be unwise to
include them into this documentation page, as the loading of the page would
become excessively slow.

Hence, you can visit the aforementioned repository and:

* download and run them locally.
* or you can launch Binder and try them online.
