This is one of those occurences! If you look at the above arguments, `[-y, x], (x, -5, 5), (y, -3, 3)`, these are all tuples/lists. `smart_plot` algorithms needs to deal with many different expressions. Here, the algorithm thinks that `[-y, x]` is a vector field and somehow `(x, -5, 5)` and `(y, -3, 3)` are two implicit expressions. So, if you need to quickly plot vector fields, always wrap them into matrices:"
