    "# Simple Parametric-Interactive Plots\n",

    "In this tutorial we are going to see how to create simple parametric-interactive plots, that is plots where we can move sliders to change parameters. The word _simple_ refer to the fact that the function we are going to use is specifically designed to use sliders (and not other type of controls). Also, we don't have many options regarding the overall layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function that allows to do that is `iplot`, which stands for _interactive plot_. Keep in mind that it only works inside Jupyter Notebook, since it is based on [holoviz's panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/)."

    "* `use_latex = True`: by default, the label of the slider will use the Latex code of the parameter-symbol to provide a legible experience (especially when dealing with symbols with subscripts, superscripts, ...); that's the theory. In practice though, at the time writing this tutorial it is a _hit or miss_ experience: most of the time this functionality doesn't work. If that is the case, then it is better to set `use_latex = False`, which will display the string representation of the symbols."
