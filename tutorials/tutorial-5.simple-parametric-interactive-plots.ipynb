    "# Simple Parametric-Interactive Plots\n",

    "In this tutorial we are going to see how to create simple parametric-interactive plots, that is, plots where we can move sliders to change parameters. The word _simple_ refer to the fact that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the function expects one-output-value widgets in order to work properly, such as sliders, spinners, etc.\n",
    "* only one plot is generated.\n",
    "* we don't have many options regarding the overall layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function that allows to do that is `iplot`, which stands for _interactive plot_. Keep in mind that it only works inside Jupyter Notebook, since it is based on [holoviz's panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/)."

    "* By moving the slider, the update only happens when we release the click from it. This behaviour improves user experience: it should minimize the lags while moving the sliders waiting for the previous evaluation to complete. Remember: in the background the symbolic expression is being numerically evaluated over the discretized domain.\n",
    "* By default, ``iplot`` uses the backends we set in configuration settings in [Tutorial 3](tutorial-3.set-default-backends.ipynb). Alternatively, we can use a different backend by setting the ``backend`` keyword argument.\n",
    "* ``(expr, (x, -10, 10), (y, -10, 10))``: with ``iplot``, we must always provide all the necessary ranges: it's required by internal algorithm in order to automatically detect the kind of expression we are trying to plot.\n",

    "  * the key represents the symbol\n",
    "  * the value is a tuple of the form (default, min, max, N [optional], label [optional], spacing [optional]). In the above case, only the first three entries were provided. This tuple will be converted to a ``param.Number``, which represent a float number and will be rendered as a slider. Alternatively, we could have used [holoviz's param library](https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Param.html):\n",
    "  ```python\n",

    "  We can use any parameter that, once rendered in a GUI, returns a single numeric value. For example ``param.Parameter, param.Integer, param.Number, param.ObjectSelector, param.Boolean``.\n",
    "* Next, we specifies the usual keyword argument to customize the plot. Note that ``n = 100`` sets the number of discretization points in both directions (x and y). Alternatively, we could set them separately with ``n1`` and ``n2``. Remember that ``iplot`` doesn't support adaptive algorithms.\n",
    "* Since ``iplot`` is a very general function, there is a risk of ambiguity: the above expression can be plotted with contours or with a 3D surface. With ``threed = True`` we ask for a 3D surface plot. In the above example, set ``threed = False`` to get a contour plot.\n",
    "* ``use_latex = True``: by default, the label of the slider will use the Latex code of the parameter-symbol to provide a legible experience (especially when dealing with symbols with subscripts, superscripts, ...); that's the theory. In practice though, at the time writing this tutorial it is a _hit or miss_ experience: most of the time this functionality doesn't work. If that is the case, then it is better to set ``use_latex = False``, which will display the string representation of the symbols.\n",
    "* `iplot` returns two very different objects depending on the value of the keyword argument `show`:\n",
    "  * `show=True` (default) returns a `panel` object that will be rendered in the output cell. We can prevent the rendering from happening by capturing this object in a variable, for example `p = iplot(...`. Then we can render it on a different cell by simply typing `p`.\n",
    "  * `show=False` returns an instance of `InteractivePlot`, which can be used for debugging purposes."
