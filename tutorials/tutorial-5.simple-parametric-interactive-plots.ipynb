    "# Simple Parametric-Interactive Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to see how to create simple parametric-interactive plots, that is, plots where we can move sliders to change parameters. The word _simple_ refer to the fact that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the function expects one-output-value widgets in order to work properly, such as sliders, spinners, etc.\n",
    "* only one plot is generated.\n",
    "* we don't have many options regarding the overall layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "`iplot`, which stands for _interactive plot_, allows us to do that. Keep in mind that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. it only works inside Jupyter Notebook, since it is based on [holoviz's panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/).\n",
    "2. it is one function to plot everything: we can plot lines, parametric lines, surfaces, contours, vectors, ...\n",
    "3. Differently from the usual plotting functions, ``iplot`` doesn't support the adaptive algorithm. The plotting domain will be uniformly discretized.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import it. We will try it on all backends to understand the pros and cons of each one."

    "* The optional keyword argument `throttled` controls the update-behaviour of the widgets. If `throttled=False`, the function will update the plot every time we move the slider. As we can see from above, this might lead to laggish user experience when the number of evaluation point is huge. By setting `throttled=True`, the function updates the plot only when we release the click from the slider.\n",

    "* ``(expr, (x, -10, 10), (y, -10, 10))``: with ``iplot``, every expression to be plotted must be put into a tuple of the form `(expr, range, label [optional])`. Remember: we must always provide all the necessary ranges, as the internal algorithm uses them to automatically detect the kind of expression we are trying to plot. Here, we are plotting a surface plot, hence we must provide two ranges.\n",
    "* Since ``iplot`` is a very general function, there is a risk of ambiguity. With `threed=True` we asked for a surface plot. Alternatively, we can create a contour plot by setting `threed=False`.\n",
    "* ``params = { d: (0.15, 0, 1) }``: we specified the dictionary of parameters. In this case there is only one parameter:\n",
    "  * the key represents the symbol\n",
    "  * the value is a tuple of the form (default, min, max, N [optional], label [optional], spacing [optional]). In the above case, only the first three entries were provided. This tuple will be converted to a ``param.Number``, which represent a float number and will be rendered as a slider. Alternatively, we could have used [holoviz's param library](https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Param.html):\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import param\n",
    "  parameters = { \n",

    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  We can use any parameter that, once rendered in a GUI, returns a single numeric value. For example ``param.Parameter, param.Integer, param.Number, param.ObjectSelector, param.Boolean``.\n",
    "* Next, we specifies the usual keyword argument to customize the plot. Note that ``n = 100`` sets the number of discretization points in both directions (x and y). Alternatively, we could set them separately with ``n1`` and ``n2``. Remember that ``iplot`` doesn't support adaptive algorithms.\n",
    "* ``use_latex = True``: by default, the label of the slider will use the Latex code of the parameter-symbol to provide a legible experience (especially when dealing with symbols with subscripts, superscripts, ...); that's the theory. In practice though, at the time writing this tutorial it is a _hit or miss_ experience: most of the time this functionality doesn't work. If that is the case, then it is better to set ``use_latex = False``, which will display the string representation of the symbols.\n",
    "* `iplot` returns two very different objects depending on the value of the keyword argument `show`:\n",
    "  * `show=True` (default) returns a `panel` object that will be rendered in the output cell. We can prevent the rendering from happening by capturing this object in a variable, for example `p = iplot(...`. Then we can render it on a different cell by simply typing `p`.\n",
    "  * `show=False` returns an instance of `InteractivePlot`, which can be used for debugging purposes."
