    "# Evaluation Algorithm and Singularity Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the plotting module works? Conceptually, it is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. it converts the symbolic expression to a function by using ``lambdify``, which will be used for numerical evaluation. Usually, the default evaluation modules are Numpy and Scipy.\n",
    "2. It will evaluate the function over the specified domain.\n",
    "3. The numerical data can be post-processed and later plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding numerical evaluation, in the previous tutorials we have seen that 2D line plots can either use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an adaptive algorithm which is going to chose where to evaluate a function in order to obtain a smooth plot. The iterative procedure minimizes some loss function (``loss_fn``) and will stop when the ``adaptive_goal`` has been reached. This is the default algorithm used by the plotting module.\n",
    "* a uniform meshing algorithm, which divides the specified range into ``n`` uniformly spaced points over which the function will be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following tutorial we are going to explore a few examples illustrating the limitations of the adaptive algorithm. In particular, we will understand when it is not appropriate to use it. Generally, if a function exhibits mid-to-high frequencies in relation to the plotting range, then it is better to switch to the uniform meshing algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also seen that we can play with ``detect_poles`` and ``eps`` in order to detect singularities. The singularity-dection algorithm is extremely simple, as it doesn't analyze the symbolic expression in any way. As a matter of fact, it only relies on the gradient of the numerical data, thus it is a post-processing step. This means than the user has to detect if a function contains one or more singularities, eventually activating the detection algorithm and playing with the parameters in order to get the expected result. This is a try-and-repeat process until the user is satisfied with the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the documentation associated to the ``plot`` function can be accessed by executing ``help(plot)``."
