    "* We need to specify the number of discretization point, `n=10`. Alternatively, we can set `n1, n2, n3` to specify the number of discretization points in the three directions. **Remembert to set `n` to a sufficiently low number**. Since `n` will be used on every direction, the internal algorithm will create 4 `n x n` matrices for 2D vector fields, and 6 `n x n x n` matrices for 3D vector fields, hence a lot more memory will be used as we increase `n`!!!\n",
