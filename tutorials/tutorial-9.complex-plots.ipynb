    "## Domain Coloring\n",
    "\n",
    "[Domain coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring) is a technique for visualizing complex functions by assigning a color to each point of the complex plane. This module uses [cplot](https://github.com/nschloe/cplot) to accomplish this task. By quoting `cplot` documentation, we can control the coloring with two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * `alpha = 1  # >= 0`: alpha can be used to adjust the use of colors. A value less than 1 adds more color which can help isolating the roots and poles (which are still black and white, respectively). alpha=0 ignores the magnitude of f(z) completely.\n",
    "> * `colorspace = \"cam16\"  # \"cielab\", \"oklab\", \"hsl\"`: colorspace can be set to hsl to get the common fully saturated, vibrant colors. This is usually a bad idea since it creates artifacts which are not related with the underlying data. From Wikipedia: *Since the HSL color space is not perceptually uniform, one can see streaks of perceived brightness at yellow, cyan, and magenta (even though their absolute values are the same as red, green, and blue) and a halo around L = 1/2. Use of the Lab color space corrects this, making the images more accurate, but also makes them more drab/pastel.*\n"

    "Also note that Plotly has a _bug_: the vertical axis is reversed, with negative values on the top and positive values on the bottom. We will get back to it later!\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can think of the result of domain coloring as a picture. The complex domain is discretized with `n1` points in the horizontal direction and `n2` points in the vertical direction. Therefore, the picture will have `(n1 - 1) (n2 - 1)` pixels. We can set `n1` and `n2` to refine the result, however Plotly will become slower and slower in rendering the results. In such cases, it is better to use a different backend, as we will later see.\n",
